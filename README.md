# Forkify Application

## Description

Uses forkify API to search for ingredients and display a list of recipes containing that ingredient. When clicking on a result, user is presented with full recipe details. Recipe servings can be adjusted and quantities are automatically generated. Recipes can also be "bookmarked", displayed in the bookmark tabs, so users can leave application and come back to find their favorite recipes still saved. Users can also create their own recipes that will display in search results and automatically be added to their list of bookmarked recipes.
