# Forkify Recipe Search Application

[Deployed on Netlify](https://forkify-kass.netlify.app/)

This is a JavaScript-driven web application that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients. Users can also bookmark recipes for later use, and they have the option to create and save their own recipes. All data is stored using the Local Storage API for a seamless and personalized experience.

## Features

1. **Search Recipes**: Users can search for recipes by entering an ingredient in the search bar. The application will fetch and display a list of recipes that match the specified ingredients.

2. **Bookmark Recipes**: Users can bookmark recipes they find interesting or want to save for later. Bookmarked recipes are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing users to access them across sessions.

3. **Create Your Own Recipes**: Users have the ability to create and save their own recipes within the application. These user-generated recipes are automatically stored in their bookmarks for easy access.
